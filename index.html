			<h3 class="heading">Regulatory Compliance</h3>	
			<p>OANDA has built an enviable performance record since the launch of our fxTrade platform in 2001. We support regulatory oversight of the industry and the protection of forex customers, and strive to meet or exceed the requirements of our regulators.

		OANDA has been in the currency business since 1996. We are an established, well-capitalized forex market maker, through our fxTrade trading platform. We are also the authoritative source for currency data for leading companies, including tax authorities, accounting firms, and financial institutions.</p>

			<h3 class="heading">Financial Compliance</h3>	
			<p>OANDA is required to file financial reports with regulators in the jurisdictions where we do business. We retain an international professional accountant firm to audit our financial statements. We compile and submit our financial data to regulators on a regular basis.

		Financial regulations require OANDA to maintain capital reserves at specified levels.</p>

			<h3 class="heading">Risk Management</h3>
			<p>OANDA keeps customer funds in accounts at top tier banks, and it is our policy to only withdraw customer funds as a direct result of their trading-related activities or withdrawal requests.

		We partner with the world's leading banks to both access and provide global forex liquidity. To manage currency exposure and risk, we use sophisticated risk management technology to net aggregate client positions automatically and anonymously, and we immediately hedge outstanding aggregated positions above predefined thresholds with our partner banks.</p>
